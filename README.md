#Shoe Stores

Shoe Stores is a site that allows the user to enter a the names of shoe stores, and the names of shoe brands, and specify which stores carry what brands, using a database. This was created for the C# Week 4 code review, and is primarily to implement a database with a many to many relationship into a normal app.

###Instructions

This can only be done on a Windows machine.

To properly implement the database schema for this program, import the .sql files from the project folder and import them into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, or another database manager.
